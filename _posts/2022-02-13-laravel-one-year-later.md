## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a PHP framework that is orignally made from Taylor Otwell. Over the years, they have developed the main front facing appliation that most people would call just a website but then they have come out with additional smaller packages to build an ecosystem that allows you to do all different sorts of things. A good example being, an entire backend that could be used to assist you when your managing dynamic content on your website, such as a blog where people post things and comment on each others content.

## Why did I use it?

Initially, I had started using it due to a work placement that I did during college where we was tasked to learn and understand this huge framework. Initially, it was quite daunting because the first time I looked at the documentation, I honestly thought I was learning a new programming language because all I really saw at a glance was snippets of code. At the time I started learning the framework, they had loads of packages that did different things that you could cherry pick from to implement into your application which extended the time it took to grasp a full understanding of what does what as a baseline understanding of it. It was quite a steep learning curve especiall since I had never done anything like this previously. I have previously done HTML but that is nothing compared to Laravel.

## Looking back

Looking back at the experience that I had with the documentation is that, when it comes to learning a framework like this, the best thing that you can do is read the documentation to make yourself aware of what is what and build a map of information in your head so when you come accross something your not sure about then you can just find the appropriate page with the answer since you know where it would be located. Additionally, one of the best things you can do when it comes to learning something like this is, just keep trying different things and allow things to break now and again; using version control helps significantly. When I had started, I setup my project and just copied and pasted commands and tried things until it would break and I would have to try and fix it. Trying to fix it would allow me to gain an understanding of the correct way of doing it, supporting me in the long term when it comes to gaining an understanding of it.
