## Well, what is Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is a Linux distrobution is quite popular among the Linux communities but normally gets overlooked because its normally the first distro people use before moving onto another that is either more complicated or has more features in a specific area that they are most interested in. When it comes to deciding on a distro, lots of factors are taken into consideration such as, what primary package manager do I want, what desktop environment do I like best and does it support the software that I want to run on it. Normally, your hardware for this operating system is not much of a concern since it isn't resource hungry at all. To put that into perspective, you can run it on a Raspberry Pi which is a computer the size of a credit card.

When it comes to Ubuntu specifically, the interface is quite easy to use and user friendly. It actually has a port to a mobile version of the operating system but that is not commonly used. The software developed for it covers most of the spectrum except when it comes to playing games that were originally made for Windows; This is where other distros do better than Ubuntu for the slight differences they have that make playing Windows games a lot easier. Personally, I have never used Ubuntu to play Windows games a lot.

## What do I use it for?

Originally, I had used it just to mess around with it but over time as circumstances changed, I eventually started doing a lot of software development on it. From the very beginning, I have always dual booted or in my situation, installed Ubuntu on one dedicated drive and Windows on another meaning that I can break and reinstall either them as much as I want and it won't ever affect the other system. The boot loader in Ubuntu detects the Windows operating system which gives me a (Grub) menu to select between them compared to the alternative method of going into the BIOS boot menu everytime I turn on my PC.

Since I started doing sofware development, I have always found doing any kind of development on a Linux or Ubuntu machine is so much simpler than doing it on a Windows machine. Just for the record too, I have never daily drived a Mac so I have nothing to mention in regard to development on a Mac. The major difference is that Ubuntu/Linux is based a lot around many packages that are independant of one another whereas Windows tends to be software that is installed with lots of dependencies and its a lot harder to manage the more granular packages or dependencies that you may need on Windows compared to Ubuntu.

A good example of this is when I had started working on Laravel (I have written a blog on it) where initially I had lots of issues with starting the server because I had lots of dependencies that was missing or it wanted that I was still trying to wrap my head around. Since its a PHP framework, in the end it turned out that I just had to install a lot of different extentions for PHP for it to work which is rather simple on Ubuntu since you can just open the package manager, search for what you want and install it which also allows for that software to be used anywhere. In contrast, Windows, you will have to download lots of different software to get it to work and in the end you could find yourself with lots of software that is incompatable with each other (which sucks).
